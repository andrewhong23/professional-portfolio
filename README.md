# professional-portfolio

## Description

This project is a professional portfolio that is going to be updated as I gain more and more experience in this field.  It is use to showcase my latest projects that I have created using various code's and uses.  I had to use various CSS styling elements that I learned in my class, as well as elements that I had to learn online. 


## Usage

This is going to be used to give to possible employers to see what kind of work I have done.  They can use this to access a summary about who I am, work experience and projects, as well as all ways to get in contact with me.
